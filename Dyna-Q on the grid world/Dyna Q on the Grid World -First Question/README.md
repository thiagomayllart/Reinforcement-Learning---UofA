# Description of the problem and plotting:

Your task is
to recreate Figure 8.3 (SB). Your learning curves should be averaged over 10 runs, with the random seed
controlled appropriately such that the number of steps per episode during the first episode is the same for
all three parameterizations of Dyna-Q. Note your results are not guaranteed to be exactly the same.
