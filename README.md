# Reinforcement-Learning-UofA
This repository includes many projects developed during the course Intelligent Systemts - 366 in the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada), taught by Richard Sutton.

All the projects implement an interface: RL-Glue (http://glue.rl-community.org/wiki/Main_Page), however, the environment and agent in every problem was completely developed by the student (Thiago Mayllart Macedo Silva).
The code was developed entirely for solving the problems proposed during the course as Assignments.

This code is not authorized for "copy and paste" and its usage may lead to plagiarism.

All the solutions and techniques followed the algorithms implemented in the book: "Reinforcement Learning:An Introduction"

# Assignments:

1) Bandit task Programming: Recreation of the learning curves for the optimistic bandit agent, and the epsilon-greedy agent in Figure 2.3 of Reinforcement Learning:An Introduction.

# Acknowledgements

All my sincere thanks to Richard Sutton (https://www.ualberta.ca/science/about-us/contact-us/faculty-directory/rich-sutton), for being able to provide us a great part of his knowledge about Reinforcement Learning and lot of techniques developed by him. An incredible professor and academic.
