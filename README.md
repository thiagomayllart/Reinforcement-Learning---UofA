# Reinforcement-Learning-UofA
This repository includes many projects developed during the course Intelligent Systemts - 366 in the University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada).

All the projects implement an interface: RL-Glue (http://glue.rl-community.org/wiki/Main_Page), however, the environment and agent in every problem was completely developed by the student (Thiago Mayllart Macedo Silva).
The code was developed entirely for solving the problems proposed during the course as Assignments.

This code is not authorized for "copy and paste" and its usage may lead to plagiarism.
